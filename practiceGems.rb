ðŸ’Ž What is a Gem?

A gem is a Ruby library or tool packaged for distribution. Gems help you avoid reinventing the wheel â€” you can just install and use code others have written.

For example:

    rails â†’ Web framework

    nokogiri â†’ HTML/XML parsing

    bcrypt â†’ Password hashing

    colorize â†’ Add color to terminal output
=end
require 'colorize'

puts "Hello".colorize(:red)

What is Bundler?

    Tracks which gems and versions your app uses

    Creates a Gemfile to list them

    Automatically installs everything needed
=end

puts "Bundled Hello!".colorize(:blue)
